Amplitude has officially supported integrations for the following game engines.

## O3DE

[O3DE](https://o3de.org) is an open source game engine to build AAA games. Amplitude is available on O3DE with an official gem
available in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/SparkyStudios/o3de-gem-ssamplitudeaudio). The gem provides deep integration into the O3DE Audio System and allow
seamless migration to and from other implementations.

## ezEngine

[ezEngine](https://ezengine.net) is a free and open source game engine available on GitHub. A full support of Amplitude is available for
ezEngine over our Audio System implementation on [our fork](https://github.com/SparkyStudios/ezEngine). You can pick the `AudioSystemPlugin` and
`AmplitudeAudioPlugin` plugins from the `Code/EnginePlugins`, and also the `AmplitudeAudio` plugin in `Code/EditorPlugins`
for editor support.
